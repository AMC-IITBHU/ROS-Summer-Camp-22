  <summary><h1>Gazebo </h1></summary>
  
  Gazebo is an open-source 3D robotics simulator. With Gazebo you are able to create a 3D scenario on your computer with robots, obstacles and many other objects. Gazebo also uses a physical engine for illumination, gravity, inertia, etc. You can evaluate and test your robot in difficult or dangerous scenarios without any harm to your robot. Most of the time it is faster to run a simulator instead of starting the whole scenario on your real robot.
