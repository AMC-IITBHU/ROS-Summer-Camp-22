## First things first...make sure to dual boot your PC with the appropriate Ubuntu version (Ubuntu18.04/ Ubuntu20.04).
### Well...we recommend using the 20.04 version, but again...

### You can take help of the following links:
- [Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.itzgeek.com/post/how-to-install-ubuntu-20-04-alongside-with-windows-10-in-dual-boot/)
- [Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/ubuntu-how-tos/how-to-install-ubuntu-18-04-alongside-with-windows-10-or-8-in-dual-boot.html)

#### Get yourself familiar with the new Operating System. Use [this link](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners) to learn how to use the linux terminal. We would highly recommend you to go through all of these commands. You don't need to memorise it, just use them again and again, and here they are on your tips!

Also just look at [gedit](https://www.howtogeek.com/413514/how-to-edit-text-files-graphically-on-linux-with-gedit/#:~:text=To%20start%20gedit%20from%20the,working%20on%20with%20no%20distractions.) once to access the usual text editor from command line.

## Now that you are familiar with linux, it is time for you to ... INSTALL ROS!!!
### Follow these [instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) to install ROS in your system (for Ubuntu 20.04 users). Ubuntu 18.04 users use [this](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu). Again, if you are stuck, you know who to reach out to :upside_down_face:
