# Hope you enjoyed the first Week!
### Now, here is the fun part...You will get to code, but code what? The Captain America Shield!! Yes, you heard that rightðŸ˜ƒ

### So, the task for the week is to create a package such that:
- It contains a client node named as spawn.py. When it is launched with appropriate arguments, it should call the spawn service to spawn a turtle in the turtlesim simulator at a specifc position and orientation.
- It contains a publisher node named as star.py. When it is launched with appropriate arguments, it should publish the required velocity for a specific turtle on the cmd_vel topic, and that turtle in the turtlesim simulator should trace out a regular star (regular here means symmetric).
- It contains a publisher node named as circle.py. When it is launched with appropriate arguments, it should publish the required velocity for a specific turtle on the cmd_vel topic, and that turtle in the turtlesim simulator should trace out a circle.
- Now, create a launch file including the above mentioned nodes and pass appropriate arguments such that the combination of turtles do something like this ðŸ‘‡
