#### Now that you have understood how to create packages, its time for you to learn some of their components...Click on the following topics one by one. Click again to collapse them back
<details>
  <summary><h1>1. ROS Nodes</h1></summary>
  
A node is nothing but an executable file inside a ROS package. It makes use of topics and services to communicate with the other nodes which are inside the same or different package.

Here is a real life analogy.
## A mobile robot controlled by a camera
#### Let‚Äôs start with a standard robotics application which involves a mobile robot and a camera. The robot has 3 ROS packages (from low to high level):
- [**Camera package: processes images and give useful info and commands to the robot**](https://github.com/AMC-IITBHU/ROS-Summer-Camp-22/edit/main/Week%201/Subpart%202/README.md#nodes-for-the-camera-package)
- [**Motion planning package: monitors and controls the robot trajectory**](https://github.com/AMC-IITBHU/ROS-Summer-Camp-22/edit/main/Week%201/Subpart%202/README.md#nodes-for-the-motion-planning-package)
- [**Hardware control package: directly controls the hardware (wheels and other actuators)**](https://github.com/AMC-IITBHU/ROS-Summer-Camp-22/edit/main/Week%201/Subpart%202/README.md#nodes-for-the-hardware-control-package)
<br>
<p align="center">

  </p>
<br>
Let‚Äôs now fill in those packages with useful nodes which will be responsible for the execution of the program.

### Nodes for the camera package
The camera package will handle a camera as an independent unit. We need a driver for the camera, to be able to program it, and get frames from it. Then we also need a program that will take those frames and do some image processing work.
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168075161-248b8e63-5f16-4eb2-aa0e-682968d3741f.jpg">
</p>
<br>
  
All those programs in blue are nodes. Each node is launched separately. First you will launch the driver, and then the image processing node. **The nodes will then communicate using ROS communication functionalities**, for example topics, services and actions.
<br><br>

### Nodes for the motion planning package
In this package you can expect to have a motion planning node, which will compute motion planning for any given robot. We can also add a path correction node, which role is to modify the motion planning due to external factors.
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168075873-68bd5600-1f63-4784-b218-c993fb4de865.jpg">
  </p>
<br>
Next step is to make the two nodes in different packages communicate each other.

Let‚Äôs link the image processing node to the path correction node. The image processing node will analyze frames coming from the camera and will send an analysis of the environment to the path correction node. This ROS node will then be able to notify the motion planning node.

### Nodes for the hardware control package
Hardware control package, as an independent unit, will control the hardware of the robot. That can be wheels, a robotic arm joints, or anything else.

We‚Äôll find some drivers to control the motors. The drivers are controlled from the main control loop node. And let‚Äôs say that the position data coming from the motor encoders is sent back to the control loop for more precise control. This data is also published by a state publisher node.
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168076263-d2b984f9-b26b-4001-a7b0-b58432432d4a.jpg">
  </p>
<br>
The motion planning node from the motion planning package will send computed trajectories to the main control loop node, inside the hardware control package.

The hardware state of the robot is published, and both the motion planning and path correction nodes are receiving it. Thus, the motion planning can be dynamically changed thanks to the hardware or camera data.

### But, what's the point of writing multiple nodes when you can jot down all of the code in a single file? Well, there are some reasons...
* Splitting the code into multiple nodes helps faster debugging and helps in organising them better.
* ROS nodes are not internally linked. They communicate only through topics and services. So, if one node crashes, others are safe.
* There are some client libraries available in ROS such as roscpp and rospy that allow nodes written in different languages (C++/ Python) to communicate. So, your are no more bounded to write all your code in a single programming language.

## Hell of theoretical stuff, isn't it?

  <summary><h1>2. ROS Topics</h1></summary>
  
A topic is a named bus over which nodes exchange messages.
  
## Our first publisher
  Let's understand ROS topics through a real world analogy of radio transmitter and receiver. Suppose we have one radio transmitter. It will send some data on a given frequency, say 98.7 frequency, so you know that if you want to receive music from the radio station, you need to connect your device to ‚Äú98.7‚Äù.

  You can see the green box here, 98.7, as a ROS topic, and the radio transmitter is a publisher of this topic. So for this case, a data stream is sent over the 98.7 topic.
<br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168092995-7addc220-8c2d-4f50-969b-2b0e403169a0.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
  
## Time to add some subscribers
  Suppose, your phone receives messages from the 98.7 topic. Your phone is then a subscriber of the topic. But for that, your phone must be able to decode the type of message that the radio transmitter is sending, apart from being on the right frequency. If it is sending AM signal, your phone should decode it. That‚Äôs why **both the publisher and subscriber must send messages with the same data structure**.

  So we have our radio transmitter and the phone, both using AM signals. They respectively publish and subscribe to the 98.7 topic.
  <br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168093045-2d9daad5-1844-4a1c-a8e5-bbe18faf9b05.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
  
## Multiple subscribers for one topic
What if you also want to listen to the radio station from your car? You just need to connect your car to the 98.7 radio. Your car should also be able to decode AM signal.
  <br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168093110-3734e565-fcac-438a-9ffe-0cddc1be553c.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
With ROS, you can have multiple subscribers for the same topic. A subscriber is not aware of the other subscribers and publisher. It only knows it is receiving data from the 98.7 topic. Thus, we can say that subscribers are anonymous.
  
## Multiple publishers for one topic
You can also have many publishers for the same topic. Imagine another radio transmitter which is also publishing an AM signal to 98.7. It can be the same radio station, it can also be another radio station. All the subscribers will receive the messages from both publishers.
<br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168093198-852db4ad-6ee4-4fb8-a01d-44fb5abff555.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
  
A publisher is also not aware of the other publishers and the subscriber of the topic. It only publishes data to the topic, and that‚Äôs it. Publishers on a ROS topic are anonymous.
  
So, each node which is publishing or subscribing to the topic is totally independent. For example, you could have 3 subscribers on the topic and no publisher. It‚Äôs still working, but the subscribers will just receive no data. If you have 2 publishers on the topic, and no subscriber, the data is just sent and no one receives it.

## Multiple publishers/subscribers inside one node
A node can publish and subscribe on many different topics.
  <br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168093295-82bc6726-94c9-414e-8009-afb399b4863d.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
  
Let‚Äôs say that the radio transmitter node number 2 is publishing AM signal on the 98.7 topic, and FM signal on the 101.3 topic. The car can subscribe to the 101.3 topic, and decode FM signal at the same time.

A node can contain multiple publishers, but also subscribers. The car, while listening to the radio, can publish its coordinates to a car_location topic.
  <br>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77807055/168093352-abc57d22-7716-4afd-a707-492ebd4867a6.jpg">
  </p>
  <br>
  
The car node has now one subscriber on the 98.7 topic, and one publisher on the car_location topic. The computer node is subscribing to the car location topic, and for the communication to be successful, both nodes are sending and receiving the same kind of message.

Well, that‚Äôs it for the analogy! You should now have a better comprehension of what is a ROS topic and when it is useful.
  
## Get back to reality

Note that for the real world analogy I used numbers with dots as topic name. This is not valid, a topic name must start with a letter, followed by letters, numbers, underscores, tildes, and slashes. For example, you could a topic named ‚Äú/radio_98_7‚Äù.

Technically speaking, the messages are sent over TCP/IP. The ROS libraries that you will use on your code, will provide you with enough abstraction so you don‚Äôt have to deal with the TCP/IP layer.
  
### Aren't topics tired of being the middlemanüò¢?

    <br><i>Topics would love the internet, isn't it? üôÅ</i>
  </p>
  <br>

## Points to Note!
- A topic has a message type. All publishers and subscribers on this topic must use the message type associated with the topic.
- As you already know, you can write a node in multiple languages, using for example the roscpp library for C++, and rospy library for Python. Well, those libraries also include the Topic functionality. So, you can create a publisher or subscriber in any ROS supported language you want, directly inside ROS nodes.
- When a node wants to publish something, it will inform the ROS master. When another node wants to subscribe to a topic, it will ask the ROS master from where it can get the data. You can see the ROS master as a DNS server for nodes to find where to communicate.
