# ROS-Summer-Camp
Hello Robot Enthusiasts!!
This repository will take you to the world of Robots Operating System. Are you ready for it?

So, before diving in, let's understand the flow of the repo. The whole content is divided into three weeks, Week 1, Week 2 and Week 3, and we will be uploading one subpart per week. Each subpart consists of some task, which you need to submit at the end of each week on the submission link provided in the respective readme files. Your submissions/ performance will be monitored and evaluated by us. 

Join this [discord server](https://discord.gg/7upTzmEjRf) where your seniors will be there to mentor you, we will have some fun, some chit chat as well as some ROS stuff to do!!


## An Introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS)
Developing a robot with a computer brain requires a bunch of software tools on the computer side—like software drivers, third party tools for computer vision and simulation tools. ROS framework gathers all these tools and manages how you develop a code for your robot.

Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, some frameworks can help you by gathering all these tools and managing how you develop code for your robot. ROS (Robot Operating System) is one of these frameworks. It’s a special framework initially developed by the Stanford AI Laboratory in 2007 for developing robots. The Open Source Robotics Foundation now maintains ROS.

The concept of ROS goes far beyond just a framework. ROS is an OS in concept because it provides all the services that any other OS does—like hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. Even though ROS is still a framework that isn't a standalone OS or an RTOS and isn't the only framework for robots, it seems to be adopted widely and have a large developers community.

ROS can be installed on a single-board computer (SBC) like Raspberry Pi-level and upwards with Ubuntu/Debian distro. However, other platforms are supported experimentally or by the community.

Here's a cool video for you to know what exactly we can do with ROS:-

## Pre-requisites
The main prerequisite is to install Ubuntu in your system. Dual boot your laptop with Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 and then move to Week 1. If you have any issues while dual booting, our discord server is there to help you :)
